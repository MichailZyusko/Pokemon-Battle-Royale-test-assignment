## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The Pokémon Battle Royale application follows a modern React architecture with:

- **Feature-based organization** for scalable code structure
- **TypeScript** for type safety and developer experience
- **React Query** for server state management
- **Tailwind CSS** for consistent styling
- **WebSocket integration** for real-time functionality

### Key Architectural Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between features, entities, and shared code
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript usage throughout the codebase
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering, caching, and bundle management
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant components and interactions
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing strategy with Jest and Testing Library

## 🔧 Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** - Modern React with concurrent features
- **TypeScript 4.9** - Type-safe JavaScript development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Radix UI** - Accessible component primitives

### State Management
- **TanStack Query** - Server state management and caching
- **React Hooks** - Local state and side effects
- **Custom Hooks** - Business logic encapsulation

### Build & Development
- **Create React App** - Zero-config React development
- **ESLint** - Code quality and consistency
- **Prettier** - Code formatting
- **Jest** - Testing framework
